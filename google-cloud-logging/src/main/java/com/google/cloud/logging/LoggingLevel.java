/**
 * This class adds some additional Java logging levels for Cloud Logging. Added levels fill in the
 * gap between Java logging levels and Cloud Logging severities.
 *
 * <p>Added levels in descending order are (between parenthesis the relation with Java logging
 * levels):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>EMERGENCY
 *   <li>ALERT
 *   <li>CRITICAL
 *   <li>ERROR ({@code WARNING < ERROR < SEVERE})
 *   <li>NOTICE ({@code INFO < NOTICE < WARNING})
 *   <li>DEBUG ({@code ALL < DEBUG < FINES}T
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Notice that {@code ERROR} is lower than {@link java.util.logging.Level#SEVERE} but higher than
 * {@link java.util.logging.Level#WARNING}. {@code DEBUG} instead is lower than {@link
 * java.util.logging.Level#FINEST} but higher than {@link java.util.logging.Level#ALL}.
